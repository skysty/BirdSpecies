# Bird-Species-Identifiaction-from-Image
Now a days some bird species are being found rarely and if found classification of bird
species prediction is difficult. Naturally, birds present in various scenarios appear in
different sizes, shapes, colors, and angles from human perspective. Besides, the images
present strong variations to identify the bird species more than audio classification. Also,
human ability to recognize the birds through the images is more understandable. So this
method uses the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 [CUB-200-2011] dataset for training as well as
testing purpose. By using deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) algorithm animage
converted into grey scale format to generate autograph by using tensor flow, where the
multiple nodes of comparison are generated.
By establishing the database of standard images features for bird species and using the
algorithm of similarity comparison, this system is proved to achieve good results in practice
